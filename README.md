## Introduction

Big Fish is a simple and addicting timing game with a pixel-art retro theme. The objective of the game is to catch as many fish as possible in a row.

## Gameplay

Gameplay is extremely simple. A player activates the timing bar by pressing on the spacebar, and stops the spacebar on a second press. Depending on the player's timing of their press and whether or not the white bar lands within the innermost green bar, the player will receive either a 'Nice Catch!' or 'Game Over' message.

Difficulty of the game increases as consecutive fish are caught. Logic is built into the animation function of the game so that the timing bar will increasing in velocity after each successful catch.

## Future Improvements
There are several features and improvements that I would like to make to Big Fish in the future. Some of these include:

* Additional animations on successful catches incorporating the use of sprites - perhaps a fish jumping out of water
* New levels of difficulty and exploration with item selection availability - different types of equipment such as various rods, hooks, and fishing bait
* Different types of fish species to catch and store in a fishing log
* An end goal of the game - perhaps a final 'Big Fish' to catch after all of the smaller fish have been caught.
